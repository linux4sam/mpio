Introduction
------------

The Microchip Peripheral I/O package provides a Python API to many of the
hardware peripherals found on boards running Linux like the
`Microchip SAMA5D2 Xplained`_, `Microchip SAMA5D3 Xplained`_, and
`Microchip SAMA5D4 Xplained`_.

*mpio* allows you to read and write to these hardware peripherals in an
easy and consistent manner from Python.  Additionally, there are utilities that
make working with these boards easier. The API is tested and there are plenty
of common use case examples.
